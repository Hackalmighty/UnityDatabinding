# Unity Databinding

This is a basic databinding framework for Unity3D. The general mechanism can be extended to work with any GUI framework and can even be used to databind aspects of the scene hierarchy itself. This packaged contains compositional and IoC related binders as well as some example binders for the NGUI library.
